How to run
-----------
1) Import all jar files available in this project, jfreechart.jar, jgraphx-4.2.2.jar and under the jfreechart folder, import all of the
    jar files there too!
2) Run from the Runner class, using Java 19.1
3) The results would be displayed in the console, the visualiser would save the route taken by each algorithm, and save
   it into a jpg file in the root folder.
